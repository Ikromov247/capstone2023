# capstone2023
All the code and data for capstone design course, 2023 Fall

In this project we were given dataset with data collected from sensors near sewage treatment plant with the following values: ou(target value), NH3, TVOCs, H2S, humidity, windspeed, winddirection, pozip and atm. The goal was to implement prediction model on the dataset provided and make predictions for future points.

In this project we collaborated with EuclidSoft, the company provided us the project and dataset. Because of privacy issues we could not upload it to the GitHub. For more information please take a look at the PDF file in the repository. Begin with the data_preprocessing notebook in the code folder and then see the implementations of various models for inference.
